# JWT Lesson

### A simple JWT example

Generates a token and encodes it as a JWT.  JWT is posted to an endpoint where it is decoded and the token is inserted in the response header.  If the header contains to correct token the client responds with success, otherwise it responds with an error message.

## To Do:

- implement dynamic POSTing to different endpoints based on form entry
- build success and error pages
- break into mini-sprints in solution branches
- clean up
